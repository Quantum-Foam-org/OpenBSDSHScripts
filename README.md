SH Scripts for OpenBSD

Also checkout my bash_library project.

These scripts will soon all be using it.  Right now the only BASH script using it is anoncvs.bash.

It is located here: https://github.com/malaimo2900/bash_library

You need to install the bash and libxml ports.  Once you install libxml port update the bash_library/lib/xmllint.bash path for xmllint.

Make sure that you have pre-loaded the OpenBSD source tree
